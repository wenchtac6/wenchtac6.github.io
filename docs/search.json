I’m especially interested in economic development, international relations, and sustainability. Latin America has a special meaning to me, shaped by my Peruvian and Ecuadorian background.\nBefore university, I attended the Giuseppe Garibaldi Agricultural Technical Institute, where I developed an early interest in sustainable development and global issues.\nThis website is a space where I share some of the academic projects and researches I’ve worked on during my studies. Feel free to explore and learn more about my work!\nYou can also check out my CV."
