    "text": "Welcome! I am an undergraduate student in International Affairs at John Cabot University in Rome, currently also pursuing a minor in Economics.\nI have a strong interest in economic development and international relations, with a particular focus on Latin America, inspired by my Peruvian and Ecuadorian background.\nPrior to university, I studied at the Giuseppe Garibaldi Agricultural Technical Institute, where I first developed an appreciation for sustainable development and global challenges.\nThrough my academic journey, I aim to explore how economic growth and social equity intersect in shaping Latin America’s role in global politics.\nOn this website, you’ll find a presentation of my research project, analyzing how international leaders portray Latin America in global discourse. Feel free to explore and learn more about my work!\nYou can also check out my CV."
