Welcome! I am an undergraduate student in International Affairs at John Cabot University in Rome, currently also pursuing a minor in Economics.

I have a strong interest in economic development and international relations, with a particular focus on Latin America, inspired by my Peruvian and Ecuadorian background.

Prior to university, I studied at the Giuseppe Garibaldi Agricultural Technical Institute, where I first developed an appreciation for sustainable development and global challenges.\
Through my academic journey, I aim to explore how economic growth and social equity intersect in shaping Latin America’s role in global politics.

On this website, you’ll find a presentation of my research project, analyzing how international leaders portray Latin America in global discourse. Feel free to explore and learn more about my work!
