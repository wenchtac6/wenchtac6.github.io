Welcome!
I'm currently studying International Affairs at John Cabot University in Rome, with a minor in Economics. I'm especially interested in economic development, international relations, and sustainability. Latin America has a special meaning to me, shaped by my Peruvian and Ecuadorian background.

Before university, I attended the Giuseppe Garibaldi Agricultural Technical Institute, where I developed an early interest in sustainable development and global issues.

This website is a space where I share some of the academic projects and researches I've worked on during my studies. Feel free to explore and learn more about my work!

You can also check out my [CV](cv/cv en.pdf).
